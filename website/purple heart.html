            <p>The Purple Heart emoji ðŸ’œ signifies more than affection. Often, it expresses deep love, unwavering support,
            and profound respect. While commonly used in romantic contexts, it also shows support for US military veterans.
            Among the BTS Army (fans of the K-pop group), it symbolizes passionate admiration.</p>
          <p>The BTS, short for Bangtan Sonyeondan, meaning bulletproof boy scouts,
            is a Korean boy band formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 consisting of 7 members.</p>
            <p>They are known for their songs and performances throughout the western world.</p>
            <p>The members often make the heart emoji to extend their gratitude and appreciation to their army of fans, also known as fandom.</p>
            <p>In return, the BTS fandom has chosen the purple heart to represent their love for the young men.</p>
            <p>The reason for choosing this particular color is that Tae, one of the band members, created the line â€˜I purple you.â€™ From there onwards, 
                the bandâ€™s fans specifically use this emoji to promote and celebrate their love for the BTS band. </p><br><br><br>
